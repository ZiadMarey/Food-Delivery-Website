## Reflection

This project is built originally for a group project for the University.
<br />

The requirement for the project was to build the simplest website possible to interact with a database. However, we took it to the next level and built an interactive user interface that makes the website easy to use and visually appealing, with alot more functionalities that originally required.
<br />

We started by building individual pages using `create-react-app`, then added communication and navigation between pages Using `react-router-6.28`, then building the backend using python's `Flask` and `SQLite`.
