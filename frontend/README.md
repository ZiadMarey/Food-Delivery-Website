## Reflection

This project is built originally for a group project for the University. The aim of the project is to learn the communication between the layers of the software stack, Front-end , Back-end and Database.

The requirement for the project was to build the simplest website possible to interact with a database. However, we took it to the next level and built an interactive user interface that makes the website easy to use and visually appealing, enhancing the user experience when dealing with the database.

We started by building individual pages using `create-react-app`, then added communication and navigation between pages Using `react-router-6.28`, then building the backend using `Flask` and `SQLite`.
